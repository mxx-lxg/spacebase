# SpaceBase

The Raspberry Pi based greenhouse control system. 

Spacebase aims to fully automate a greenhouse in a way that is easy to use and expand. The ultimate goal is to be able to put your plants in a greenhouse, fire up Spacebase and leave your plants alone until it is time to harvest. I started developing this project to bridge the gap between my love for gardening and tinkering with electronics... and because i keep forgetting to water my vegetables. 

As the name kind of suggests, i got inspired by the spacebucket community. You can probably use SpaceBase to control a spacebucket as well. 

## Key features 

* automated opening and closing of windows, based on temperature, as well as time of day
* automated irrigation of multiple zones/pots
* water-management
* emergency defrosting
* logging and displaying information like soil-moisture, temperature, humidity, sun-exposure and water-usage

## Basic use

1. Clone this repository into the pi-users home directory and copy the autostart file into the autostart directoy. 
2. connect hardware modules
3. reboot
4. ???
5. profit

To manually start Spacebase simply execute `sudo python3 spacebase.py` inside the system folder. 

> Mind that sudo is required for keyboard access.

## Autostart

Place the greenhouse.desktop file in  `/home/pi/.config/autostart` and modify the path to spacebase.py accordingly.

## Configuration

In the config file temperatures are stated in Â°Celsius. Time is stated in Seconds.

## Hardware modules / Serial API

Most hardware modules provided in this repo are based on Arduinos and written as PlatformIO projects. When plugged into the control system via USB they should automatically be detected on startup. I will make a detailed documentation for the Serial API available as soon as i get to it, so you can integrate your own hardware.

## Manual controls

keyboard keys are bound as followes:

`1` force close windows

`2` force open windows

`3` set windows to atomated mode

`4` run window recalibration cycle

`7` toggle heater on/off

## Work-In_Progress / Testing

* automated irrigation and water management 

## Planned features

* web-interface
* E-Ink display support (regular affordable Pi-displays are useless in full sunlight)

## Far future planned features

* control of energy curtains
* control of artificial light sources
* air-circulation and -ventilation
* geothermal AC (fresh and circulating air)
* general/modular AC
* MQTT support (integration into Home Assistant)
* support for multiple greenhouses (might become a separate project)
* some form of robotics-integration to remotely inspect individual plants
* automated fertilizer application
